<h2>What is Black Tea?</h2>
<br><img src="oleg-guijinsky-21357-unsplash.jpg" witdh="100%">
<p>When people talk generally of tea in Western culture, they’re often referring to black tea. Sun tea, sweet tea, iced tea, afternoon tea…these well-known categories of tea are typically made using black tea. Even the popular English Breakfast and Earl Grey blends are made from black tea leaves.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to Eastern culture—in countries like China and Japan—where tea typically refers to green tea. So what’s the difference between black and green tea? And how did black tea become so popular in the West?</p>
